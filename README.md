# SUPERVISED-AND-UNSUPERVISED-LEARNING-WITH-R

## SUPERVISED LEARNING

### TARGETED ADS
Targeted advertising is a form of online advertising that focuses on the specific traits, interests, and preferences of a consumer. Advertisers discover this information by tracking your activity on the Internet. 
In this project, I have used supersised learning techniques with R to identify which individuals are most likely to click on an ad in a Kenyan entrepreneur's blog. 

### METRIC FOR SUCCESS
Give conclusive recommendations based on the EDA results and the modeling results; these should include the factors that would make a person click on the advertisement. 

### CONTEXT
A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads. 


## UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

### CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION
Customer segmentation is a popular technique employed widely by sales and marketing teams. It allows the teams understanf the characteristics of different groups of customers and how to treat each group in terms of product recommendations based on their purchase histories. 
In this project, I have used unsupervised learning techniques with R to identify and understanding characteristics of different customer groups using clusters. 

### METRIC FOR SUCCESS
Successfully identify the characteristics of various customers based on which cluster they fall to give better insights. 

### CONTEXT 
Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.
